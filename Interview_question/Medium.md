31. **What are pure components?**  
Pure components are React components that render the same output given the same props and state. `React.PureComponent` performs a shallow comparison of props and state to decide if it should re-render.

32. **Describe how context differs from props.**  
While both context and props allow you to pass data through the component tree, props do so from parent to child directly, while context allows you to share values between components without explicitly passing through every level of the tree.

33. **Explain React's reconciliation process.**  
Reconciliation is the process by which React updates the DOM by comparing the current and next versions of a component tree to efficiently update only what's necessary.

34. **How do you optimize a React application's performance?**  
There are several methods: use `PureComponent`, utilize memoization, optimize state updates, use `React.memo` for functional components, utilize lazy loading, and code-splitting, among others.

35. **What is React Portals and where can you use it?**  
Portals allow you to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. They're useful for modals, pop-ups, or any UI piece that needs to break out of its container.

36. **How do you implement server-side rendering (SSR) in React?**  
SSR involves rendering React components on the server and sending the HTML to the client. Libraries like Next.js simplify this process for React.

37. **What is lazy loading and how can you implement it in React?**  
Lazy loading is a technique to defer loading of resources until they are needed. In React, `React.lazy()` lets you render dynamic imports as regular components. It's often paired with `Suspense`.

38. **Differentiate between `shallow rendering` and `mount rendering`.**  
Shallow rendering tests components as a unit and ensures that your tests aren't indirectly asserting on behavior of child components. Mount rendering involves rendering the component into the DOM, which ensures that both parent and child components function correctly.

39. **What is the purpose of `shouldComponentUpdate`?**  
`shouldComponentUpdate` is a lifecycle method that allows you to opt out of rendering by returning `false` if a component's output is not affected by a change in state or props.

40. **How can you handle AJAX in React?**  
You can use any JavaScript library like Axios or the Fetch API. Typically, AJAX calls are made in the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method or inside `useEffect` hooks.

41. **Explain how `forwardRefs` are used in React.**  
`forwardRef` creates a React component that forwards the `ref` it receives to another component. It's useful for library components or HOCs that pass props through to children but also want to pass down refs.

42. **What is the difference between `useCallback` and `useMemo`?**  
Both are used for optimization. `useCallback` returns a memoized callback, while `useMemo` returns a memoized value. The former is useful to prevent unnecessary renders caused by creating functions on every render, and the latter is for expensive calculations.

43. **How do you share code between components?**  
You can use utility functions, higher-order components, custom hooks, or Context depending on the kind of logic or data you want to share.

44. **What is suspense in React?**  
Suspense allows your components to “wait” for something before rendering, typically used in conjunction with `React.lazy()` for code-splitting.

45. **Explain the concept of hooks rules.**  
Hooks rules include: only call Hooks at the top level (not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions), and only call Hooks from React functions.

46. **How do you test React components?**  
You can use libraries like Jest and React Testing Library. Jest for assertions and test running, and React Testing Library to render components and query the DOM.

47. **What are the major problems you have encountered in React and how did you solve them?**  
This is subjective. Common problems might include state management complexities (solved with Redux or Context), performance issues (optimized with memoization, lazy loading, etc.), or prop drilling (addressed with Context or state management libraries).

48. **How can you use CSS in React?**  
There are several ways: inline styles, CSS Modules, styled-components, or traditional CSS files linked in public/index.html.

49. **What are styled-components?**  
Styled-components is a library for React and React Native that allows you to use component-level styles in your application with tagged template literals.

50. **How do you manage state in large-scale applications?**  
State can be managed using local component state, Context, or third-party libraries like Redux or MobX depending on the complexity and requirements of your application.

51. **What is Redux?**  
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you manage global state in a consistent manner across large applications.

52. **Explain the three principles of Redux.**  
1) Single source of truth: The state of your whole application is stored in one state tree.
2) State is read-only: The only way to change the state is to emit an action.
3) Changes are made with pure functions: Reducers are pure functions that specify how the state changes in response to an action.

53. **What are actions and reducers in Redux?**  
Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are dispatched in response to user actions or system events. Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions.

54. **How do middlewares work in Redux?**  
Middlewares provide a third-party extension point between dispatching an action and the moment it reaches the reducer. They're used for logging, crash reporting, making asynchronous calls, etc.

55. **What is the use of the Redux Thunk middleware?**  
Redux Thunk allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action, making it possible to handle asynchronous operations within actions.

56. **How do you handle side-effects in Redux?**  
Using middlewares like Redux Thunk, Redux Saga, or Redux Observable.

57. **Differentiate between `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps`.**  
`mapStateToProps` connects a part of the Redux state to the props of a React component. `mapDispatchToProps` connects Redux actions to React props.

58. **What are selectors in Redux?**  
Selectors are functions used for obtaining slices of store state. Libraries like `reselect` can be used to create memoized selectors to optimize performance.

59. **How do you use third-party libraries, like lodash or moment, in React?**  
You can install them via npm or yarn, import them in your component file, and then use them as required.

60. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of using React?**  
Advantages: Component-based, virtual DOM for performance, strong community support, flexibility in architecture choices. Disadvantages: Steep learning curve for beginners, requires understanding of additional libraries for state management and routing, JSX syntax might be confusing for some.
